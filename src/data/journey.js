One of the projects I did is a clone of Netflix where I used an API to get list of movies I could use in the project. I also tried merging this project and the Netflix landing page I created last month which gave me so much more understanding and learning of React. During this month, I tried familiarizing myself with Remix framework by following a blog project tutorial but decided to focus more on React.",
