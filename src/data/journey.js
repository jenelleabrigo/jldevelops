One of the projects I did is a clone of Netflix where I used an API to get list of movies I could use in the project. I also tried merging this project and the Netflix landing page I created last month which gave me so much more understanding and learning of React. During this month, I tried familiarizing myself with Remix framework by following a blog project tutorial but decided to focus more on React.",

But this month, I started watching a 4hrs tutorial of Vue js and it clicked differently, it's like it is something I wanted to pursue. From there, I started reading more of its documentation, learning some of its lilbraries/framework like vuetify, vuex, pinia, and vue-router. I even created a simple Leave management app with vue and simple CRUD using axios and json server. This time, I'm confident to create this using vue so I proposed this to my manager with a simple presentation and he was delighted with this idea so he gave me permission to proceed! I'm still in progress in creating the backend and database of this proposed project during my vacant times. I decided to go on with Laravel and mySQL since it is somehow similar with the company's proprietary PHP framework being used. ",
